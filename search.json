You can always leave or manage your membership through Google Groups. When responding to an offer, make sure you read the listing in detail \u0026ndash; unrelated responses are a huge factor for a low response rate.\nOf course, make sure to also use other ways to look for a room, such as WG Zimmer or Woko.\nLooking for a flatmate Email the group with anything you\u0026rsquo;ve got, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to join the group youself. The best is if you have a link to your already existing ad (such as on WG Zimmer) that has more information about the room (address, size, price, pictures, description of flatmates, and so on).\nYou will hear back if any of the candidates are interested.\nFrequently Asked Questions See the questions below or contact us if you have a new question.\nWhat are some other popular websites for finding student rooms in Zurich? The most popular is WG Zimmer, but check out also WOKO, Juwo and Flatfox. What is WOKO / Juwo? WOKO is the most popular provider of student accommodation in Zurich. A non-profit organisation offerinf some of the most affordable student housing options, including single rooms, shared apartments, and studios. Similarly, Juwo (short for Jugendwohnnetz) is a non-profit providing affordable housing options for students of age 16 \u0026ndash; 25, offering a range of different housing options, including apartments, shared flats, and communal living arrangements.\nTo rent a room from WOKO or Juwo, you must be enrolled in a university in Zurich and under 28, commonly referred to as the Woko criteria.\nWhen should I start looking for a room? It is recommended to start looking for a student room in Zurich at least 2-3 months in advance, as the demand for student housing is extremely high. Even 4-6 months in advance is not too early. Can international students rent student rooms in Zurich? Of course. If you\u0026rsquo;re subletting from Woko, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to provide additional documentation such as proof of enrollment in a university in Zurich.
